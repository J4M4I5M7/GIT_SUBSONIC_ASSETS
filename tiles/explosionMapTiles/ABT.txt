Different explosion colors that correlate to the different bomb types.

At first I was thinking Magenta, red, yellow, and orange because they are
all warm colors. And warm colors will be DANGEROUS in my game.

However...
I feel magenta and red are too close to each other.
So, I am going to use
RED,YELLOW, and orange.
Or maybe.
MAGENTA, Yellow, and Orange.

And then... For the 4th, the largest explosion type...
WHITE.
