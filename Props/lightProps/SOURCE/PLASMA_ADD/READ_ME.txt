PLAMSA Lights are ADDITIVE LIGHTS
that give a white hot glow to things.
They are used to give an extra boost of polish to light fixtures by adding that white
hot sparkle that makes something read as a light source.

Without plasma, your lights kind of look like, "Invisible lights".
You see an area of the game is lighter, but haven't a clue where the light is coming from.

This plasma will also be used to give directional indicators to bombs by baking plasma onto the plasma map where-ever bombs have
been initially placed in the level.


PLASMA LIGHTS LIGHS HAVE BLACK (0xFF000000) Backgrounds with 100% alpha.
This is because pre-multiplied alpha messes with our calculations, and if we want to quickly re-render a stack of lights,
we will have to abide by this coloring rule.
