All Lumen-Lights and Plasma-Lights will be stored as Alpha-Generic-Lights in our REPO.
The game will the be responsible for adding the proper background color.


SOLID BLACK BG == PLASMA-LIGHT (Because plasma is additive, and thus a black BG has no effect) (Adding 0 gets original number)
SOLID WHITE BG == LUMEN-LIGHT  (Because lumen  is multiplicative, and thus a white BG has no effect. 255 == 100% == 1. Multiply by 1 gets original number.
