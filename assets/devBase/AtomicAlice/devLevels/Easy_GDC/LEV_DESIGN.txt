
This folder of levels:

Is arranged so that there are 4 clusters/chunks of levels that can be played in any order by someone who has never ever played our game before:

The chunks of levels are designed to teach:

1. 4 way slow bomb behavior.
2. skull bomb behavior.
3. vertical bomb behavior.
4. horizontal bomb behavior.

All chunks should stand alone. Meaning we can give ANY of these 4 chunks to a playtester,
and they will figure out the mechanics.

We are focusing MINIMALISTICALLY.
So only INDIGO_TITANIUM and TEAL_VENTS for our geometry.
Because these types do NOT move and are indestructable.

Even though I want the game to be about DESTRUCTABLE stuff...
We need to introduce the BOMBS first. AND THEN introduce destructable tiles
AFTER the player understands the behavior of all the bombs.
