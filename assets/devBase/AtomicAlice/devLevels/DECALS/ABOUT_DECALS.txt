Atomic Alice uses 16x16 tiles. So if these decal .PNG files are for
Atomic Alice, they must be divisible by 16 on the width and height.

Decals must be named:
LevelDecal_0001 - LevelDecal_9999
Decals are in a decal folder, rather than in level folder because
a decal can be RE-USED for other levels.

Each level set has a .JSON file called:
LevelMetaData_I  (intro levels meta data)
LevelMetaData_T  (TWITCH levels meta data) Twitch may end up with the external display name of "RUSH" in the final game.
LevelMetaData_P  (PUZZLE levels meta data)
LevelMetaData_H  (HELL levels meta data)
LevelMetaData_E  (EASY levels meta data)
LevelMetaData_   (Default meta data. Hence nothing after the underscore)


Decals will be loaded into the game similiarily to levels.
Rather than being loaded like assets.
This being because of the more flexible nature of how many decals we will need.

Use another instance of the same type of object that loads PNG levels to load the DECAL information.
Except... Use the sub-class (base-class) of that object.
Because we want the decal list to be universal.
We don't want a HARD decal list. an EASY decal list. ETC.
We just want ONE decal list, and then meta data for hard,easy,twitch levels that points to that data to be
displayed.
