Auto-Game 900 is a game that plays itself.
There are no controls. The character simply auto-runs right, then left each time it hits a wall.
The levels have been designed so that you can beat them without playing.

There are movement presets. 1 or more of those presets beats a level.

Which preset you get depends on a dice roll.

Roll for:
1. Jumpiness
2. Speed

Hmm...

Dice roll requires more programming... Maybe no dice roll.
The fun of the game is watching it play.
