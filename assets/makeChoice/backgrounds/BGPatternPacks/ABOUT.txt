These are the packages that contain pre-designed tile-based backgrounds.
The dimensions of the .PNG signify the width and height in tiles of the backgrounds
stored within the PNG pack.

Each .PNG file contains 24 backgrounds.
This is because I am bit-packing 24 bit-arrays into the PNG file.
Since the color of RBG is 24 bit, I have 24 bit masks.
