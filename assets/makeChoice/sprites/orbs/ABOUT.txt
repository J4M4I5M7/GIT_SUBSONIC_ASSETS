These are the orbs that revolve around you.
You can have up to 6.
Why 6? Close to candy crush's 5 moves, but
allows for a symmetrical pattern when you are completely full.
A hebrew star rather than a pentagram.
Design wise, I like the symmetry.


Tiny Orb: Revolves around you.
Tiny Crack Orb: When you die, one of your orbs cracks and is destroyed.
Big Orb: If you get more than 6 orbs, the 7th turns into a larger glowing orb.
This larger glowing orb gets you a special trophy when you put it into the exit door.
