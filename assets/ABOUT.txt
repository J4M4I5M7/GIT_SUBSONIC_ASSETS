
AS OF: 2013.11.08:
Stripped all of the assets folder contents from:
C:\DEV\FLASH_V2\FV2_CODE\LIBRARIES\JM_GAME_LIBS\flixelBasedGames\subSonicShock\assets

And putting it in here.

This is because I want GIT to manage my assets. And Mercurial to manage my code.


//Current Goal:
1. Get game to operate on an "assetPack"
   This way, the game's assets can be easily switched out!
